If you are part of a company or group whose target audience is developers, you probably have a Developer Relations, Developer Advocate(DA), or Technical evangelism group. This group is usually the first point of contact that users have with the company and the other way around too.

In this post, I want to show you the importance you have as a Developer Advocate, even if your title is not Developer Advocate!

The tasks of a developer advocate usually revolve around awareness, onboarding, and retention. (A less formal task is to also get them excited about using the technology). But I believe that the role of a developer advocate is to enable everyone in the company and in the community to be developer advocates themselves. 

Am I saying that my role is not needed and that everyone should replace me? Yes, but that’s honestly not realistic so I’m going to focus on you as a Developer Advocate(I know that's not your title, but bear with me).



### I’ll take a few things out of the way first, as I think that these are a must for any technology/company:
>
> 1. The technology is solving a real problem.
>
> 2. The technology is great and we believe in it.
>
> 3. We want our users to succeed as our success is tied to theirs.
> 



Now that the road is clear, let’s talk about why everyone is a developer advocate. Whether you interact with the end-users directly or not, your work impacts the developers' experience with your company and technology. Are you part of the legal team and don’t understand that the community loves open source projects? Your decisions will impact developers! That’s why we are all advocates.



### The top 3 things every DA should be:
>
> * You need to be an expert in every single feature of your product! That doesn't mean you need to know it all, but you should know who to ask and who to connect with. 
>
> * You need to be an industry expert. Do you need to have hands-on experience? Not really, but to leverage your company's collective experience.
>
> * You need to be a great communicator. You just need to.
>	


You might be wondering, so who is going to write that blog post, that tutorial, that YouTube video, or attend that conference? You can! But more seriously, probably the people with the “Developer Advocate” title in their business cards should.


But as we discussed, you, with what you do as part of your job are a Developer Advocate too!


I hope you enjoyed the read and that you can go back and start advocating for your developers.
