Dirty Hal was (because it is no longer available) a mobile game inspired by two main things: Ren & Stimpy and the Wario Ware franchise. Meaning, lots of micro games with the visual style of a 90’s cartoon.

The game’s name comes from the main character; Hal. My good friend and art director 
[Marvick Núñez](https://twitter.com/elMarvick) (btw, go watch his movie “La Liga de los Cinco”) and I designed him after his idea of a dumb, but good intentioned guy.

The whole designing process was so fun. Marvick had a lot of experience on this, so I got to learn a lot about animation and character design. We had multiple iterations before nailing the right character. Which, I still love today and hope I can use it again in another project.

Here’s the first batch of sketches Marvick did once we had an idea of Hal’s personality. I remember smiling when I saw them for the first time. I loved them all!

By iteration 2, we had a clear idea of preferring a monster over a human, so we leaned a bit more towards that. One thing was for sure, Hal was not going to be athletic or slim. He was more the couch potato type.

In this iteration, I asked Marvick if we could explore having Hal as a horned monster. I liked the result, I think he didn’t :p. But for the type of game and character we were making, it was not a great fit.

I think we knew where we wanted to take the character to since the beginning, because we agreed this was the character we wanted. Then we just had to go with the colors.

I loved the red/orange variation. But that was too close to Stimpy's color.

We’ve made it this far without seeing the game and Hal animated, here’s the launch trailer we made.

As for the game play, we usually designed some micro games on paper/iPad first.

And then he would refine them and get an idea of colors before jumping into the @unity3d implementation.

[Brian Cubría](https://twitter.com/BrianRoke) was in charge of the music, which was so amazing, you can even buy the main song on his bandcamp page.
